# Predicting-Visitor-Behavior-on-E-Commerce-Websites-Using-Machine-Learning-Models

Feature Informations :
1.	Administrative: The number of administrative pages the user visited on the website. These pages might include account management, contact forms, or terms of service pages.
2.	Administrative_Duration: The total time (in seconds) the user spent on administrative pages during their session.
3.	Informational:The number of informational pages the user visited. These pages could provide details about products, services, or general company information.
4.	Informational_Duration: The total time (in seconds) the user spent on informational pages during their session.
5.	ProductRelated: The number of product-related pages the user visited. These would typically be product listings, descriptions, or category pages.
6.	ProductRelated_Duration: The total time (in seconds) the user spent on product-related pages during their session.
7.	BounceRates:The percentage of visitors who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page (i.e., single-page sessions).
8.	ExitRates: The percentage of users who leave the website from a particular page, indicating how frequently that page is the last in the user’s session.
9.	PageValues: A metric showing the average value of a page, typically calculated by dividing the total revenue generated by a page by the number of unique pageviews.
10.	SpecialDay: A value indicating whether the visit occurred near a special day (e.g., holidays, sales events). The value is usually between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate that the session occurred close to a special day.
11.	Month: The month in which the session occurred, which could be useful for understanding seasonal trends (e.g., "Jan" for January, "Feb" for February).
12.	OperatingSystems: The type of operating system the user was using during their visit (e.g., Windows, iOS, Android).
13.	Browser: The type of web browser used by the visitor (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
14.	Region: The geographical region from which the user accessed the website, typically grouped by country or continent.
15.	TrafficType: The source or type of traffic that led the user to the website (e.g., direct traffic, organic search, paid ads).
16.	VisitorType: Indicates whether the visitor is a "New Visitor," "Returning Visitor," or other types. This can help analyze the behavior of repeat visitors versus first-time users.
17.	Weekend: A binary indicator (0 or 1) showing whether the visit occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday).
18.	Target:
The target variable (also known as the label). It typically indicates the outcome of interest for classification, such as whether the session resulted in a purchase or not.
These feature names suggest that the dataset is related to user behavior on an e-commerce website, with the goal likely being to predict some user behavior (such as conversion or not) based on their session data.





The dataset contains a total of 18 columns and 12,330 rows. It is a mixed dataset containing numerical and categorical variables. The dependent variable is “Target,” which is a binary variable. You need to develop a model to predict it.
Questions
1.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the data. Some example questions that could be answered are:
   a.What is the distribution of the Target variable?
   b.What different patterns are present for visiting customers?
   c.What is the correlation between exit and bounce rates? 
2.Identify which variables are important for predicting the Target variable.
3.Develop machine learning or deep learning models to predict the Target variable. Compare the models and select the best one for this dataset.


In this machine learning model project, I fit SVM model and Random Forest Model.
